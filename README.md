Hi! This is for a lab. Unless you are my professor, I don't even know why you are here.

I made a little game that's somehow functional
The write class lets you type into the file. Currently, pray that what is typed is a number and a singular line because right now I'm at a point where _something_ works. The read class lets you guess what is typed into the file, then compares the line of text you guessed to the actual file. You win if your guess matches the content. Making it more specific to ints will come in the Threads Lab. "Oh but why can't you do it now?" because typing with nails is hard.
