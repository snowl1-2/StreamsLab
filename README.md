Hi! This is for a lab. Unless you are my professor, I don't even know why you are here.

I made a little game that's somehow functional
The write class lets you type into the file. Pray that what is typed is a number
The read class lets you guess what is typed into the file, then compares the line of text you guessed to the actual file. You win if it matches

Making it more functional ints will come in the Threads Lab

typing with nails is hard lol
