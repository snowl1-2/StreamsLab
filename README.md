I modified the game a little bit. 

The original multiplayer version still exists, but there is now a singleplayer version! While the application is picking a "random" value and writing it to a file, there is now a little animation that will play when it is happening. How is this obtained, you may ask? Well, it is this thing called multiple threads when each thread is called in the main method, they start simultaneously. You no longer have to pray that a number between 0 and 20 is picked, because I have enforced it for you. You still win if your guess matches the answer. Let the games begin!
